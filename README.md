# BA_thesis
Welcome to the repository for my thesis on anger perception in individuals with sub-clinical levels of Social Antiety Disorder!
To get an overview of the analysis, open the script 'Master BA'. This is where all digital products are created. The script loads in functions from the folder 'functions', which were created to de-clutter the main script. The script uses functions from the 'here' package, which enables you to download the scripts and run it without having to change the paths (provided you have the data from the project). Additional scripts were created to keep the main script easy to read and to the point. These are 'assumption checks', where assumptions of the models created in the 'BA-master' script are tested. The script 'Calculating group scores' are used to calculate means and standard deviations of different groups in the study, which were reported in the thesis. Here the describtive tables are likewise created.
